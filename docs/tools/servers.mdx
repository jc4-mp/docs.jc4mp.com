# Servers

To host your own JC4MP server, you'll need to download the server files.

## Windows

TODO

## Linux

The only supported Linux distros are Ubuntu 24.04 and above. This is because JC4MP uses features from C++23 feature set, and this requires g++14 and above for full compliance. g++14 (and necessary dynamic system dependencies) only runs on Ubuntu 24.04 and above, so we can only support those distro versions. Please see below for a full compatibility matrix. As more support is added, this table will be updated. The versions below are those that have been tested and validated by the team.
