# Getting Featured

Some servers go above and beyond the usual freeroam experience to craft a truly unique experience for their players. To reward the time and effort that server developers put into doing this, we have a featured server program.


Featured servers are displayed prominently on the side of the main server list. This helps players find these servers easier than a regular server. By becoming a featured server, you'll likely see an increase in players.

## Requirements

To become a featured server, **your server must have a unique experience that you created**. This can be done with scripts, mods, or a combination of both. 

Some examples that might be featured are:

- A server with a custom modpack that overhauls many aspects of the game _that you created_
- A server that has a unique gamemode created with our scripting API _that you created_
- A server with some resources and mods you downloaded from the internet, but you also created a custom gamemode with our scripting API

Some examples that would not be featured are:

- A server with the default freeroam resources
- A server with a modpack you downloaded from the internet, or a server with a bunch of scripts you downloaded from the internet
- A server with mostly default resources, but you restyled the UI and added a few things here and there, plus a new menu to see players on the map
- A server with a unique gamemode that you downloaded on the internet (only the creator of an open source mod or gamemode can be featured for that work)

To summarize: **you need to put in the effort to create something unique and original**. It can be open source or closed source, but it must be something you created yourself, and a large enough experience to be worth featuring. Remixing others' work isn't enough. We want to see the effort you put in, and we want to feature that. We don't care about your player count.
