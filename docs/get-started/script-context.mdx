# Script Context

Every `.lua` script runs in isolation of every other `.lua` script. This means that each script has no knowledge of the other, and all variables are completely isolated.

For example, if you declare a non-local variable in one script:
```lua
-- resources/test/client/main.lua

MyGlobalVar = 1
```

Another script in the same resource (or any other resource) **_cannot_** access it:
```lua
-- resources/test/client/main2.lua

print(tostring(MyGlobalVar)) -- Prints "nil"
```

If you want to share static data and functionality between scripts (eg. in the example above), you can use **[Modules](/shared-api/modules.md)**. If you want to share dynamic data between scripts at runtime, such as telling a script to add one to a counter when a user does an action, you can use **[Events](/shared-api/events.md)**.
