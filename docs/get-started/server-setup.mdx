# Server Setup

Get ready to launch your very own Just Cause 4 Multiplayer server! ðŸš€ In just a few simple steps, you'll have your server up and running, ready to welcome players from around the world.

Follow this guide step-by-step, and you'll be hosting chaos in no time!

## Step 1: Download the Server

First things first - you'll need to download the server files for your platform. Head over to the [Servers](/tools/servers) page and grab the latest build that matches your system.

**Important:** Make sure the server version matches your client version - players can only connect if their client version matches the server version exactly!

:::tip Linux Users
If you're running Linux, make sure you're on Ubuntu 24.04 or above. Check out the [Linux Compatibility](/tools/servers#linux-compatibility) section for more details!
:::

## Step 2: Generate Your Config File

Once you've downloaded and extracted the server files, run the server for the first time. This will automatically create a default configuration file at `cfg/config.json` with all the necessary settings!

Simply start your server executable - it will generate the config file and then exit (or you can stop it manually). Don't worry about any errors you might see during this first run - we'll configure everything next!

## Step 3: Customize Your Server Name and Description

Open up `cfg/config.json` in your favorite text editor. You'll see a default configuration file with all the necessary fields.

Update these two fields to make your server unique:

- **`name`** - Choose a catchy name that will appear in the server browser!
- **`description`** - Write a fun description that tells players what your server is all about!

```json
{
    "name": "My Awesome JC4MP Server",
    "description": "Come join us for epic multiplayer chaos and destruction!",
    // ... rest of config
}
```

## Step 4: Get Your JC4MP Server Key

To make your server appear on the official [JC4MP server list](https://servers.jc4mp.com), you'll need a server key!

1. Visit the [JC4MP Server Dashboard](https://servers.jc4mp.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Steam account
3. Generate a new server key (it will look like `JC4MP_pBJVVEZXi3V1e3FDTC039hnc2QYAXloP`)
4. Copy the key and paste it into the `key` field in your `config.json`

:::warning Keep Your Key Safe
**Never share your server key with anyone!** This key is unique to your server and should be kept private. If you need multiple servers, generate a separate key for each one.
:::

## Step 5: Get Your Steam Web API Key

Your server needs a Steam Web API key to authenticate players through Steam. Don't worry - this is free and easy to get!

1. Visit [Steam's Web API Key page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
2. Log in with your Steam account
3. Enter a domain name (you can use any valid domain, such as `example.com` - this is just for identification)
4. Click "Register" and copy your API key
5. Paste it into the `steam_web_api_key` field in your `config.json`

:::tip One Key, Many Servers
You can use the same Steam Web API key for all your servers - no need to generate a new one for each server!
:::

## Step 6: Add Your Server Icon and Banner (Optional but Recommended!)

Make your server stand out in the server browser with custom images!

### Server Icon
- **Size:** 512x512 pixels (square)
- **Format:** PNG, JPG, or WEBP
- **Max Size:** 1MB
- **Hosting:** Use Imgur, Steam, Gravatar, ImageKit, or Cloudinary

Add your icon URL to the `icon_url` field:

```json
{
    "icon_url": "https://example.com/my-server-icon.png",
    // ... rest of config
}
```

### Server Banner
- **Size:** 1280x720 maximum (766x192 recommended, landscape)
- **Format:** PNG, JPG, or WEBP
- **Max Size:** 2MB
- **Hosting:** Use Imgur, Steam, Gravatar, ImageKit, or Cloudinary

Add your banner URL to the `banner_url` field:

```json
{
    "banner_url": "https://example.com/my-server-banner.png",
    // ... rest of config
}
```

:::info Image Guidelines
Using inappropriate or offensive images will result in your server being blocked from the server list. Keep it clean and fun!
:::

## Step 7: Configure Your Firewall

Before starting your server, make sure your firewall allows the necessary ports through!

By default, your server uses port **7777** for player connections. The server also opens a HTTP server on port **7778** (port + 1) for server information and mod distribution.

**Make sure both ports are open:**
- Port `7777` (or whatever port you set in the config)
- Port `7778` (or port + 1)

If you're using a different port, adjust accordingly - always allow both your main port and port+1!

## Step 8: Start Your Server!

Everything is configured? Excellent! It's time to launch your server and watch the magic happen! ðŸŽ‰

Start your server executable and you should see it initialize. Once it's running:

1. Your server will automatically appear on the [JC4MP server list](https://servers.jc4mp.com) (if you set `announce` to `true` and have a valid `key`)
2. Players can now find and connect to your server!
3. You can connect yourself using the JC4MP launcher

## What's Next?

Congratulations! Your server is now running!
