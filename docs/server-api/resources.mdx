# Resources

These APIs allow you to manage and control resources on the server. Resources are individual packages or modules that contain game logic, scripts, and assets.

## Global Methods

#### `Resources.Start(resourceName: string): string | nil`

Starts the specified resource by name. Returns `nil` if the resource was successfully started, or a string error message if it failed.

Example usage:

```lua
local error = Resources.Start("my_gamemode")
if error then
    print("Failed to start resource: " .. error)
else
    print("Resource started successfully")
end
```

#### `Resources.Stop(resourceName: string): string | nil`

Stops the specified resource by name. Returns `nil` if the resource was successfully stopped, or a string error message if it failed.

Example usage:

```lua
local error = Resources.Stop("my_gamemode")
if error then
    print("Failed to stop resource: " .. error)
else
    print("Resource stopped successfully")
end
```

#### `Resources.Restart(resourceName: string): string | nil`

Restarts the specified resource by name. This is equivalent to stopping and then starting the resource. Returns `nil` if the resource was successfully restarted, or a string error message if it failed.

Example usage:

```lua
local error = Resources.Restart("my_gamemode")
if error then
    print("Failed to restart resource: " .. error)
else
    print("Resource restarted successfully")
end
```
