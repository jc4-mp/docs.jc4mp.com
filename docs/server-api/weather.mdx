# Weather

Manipulate weather events and properties. The "sync" functions are used to sync weather events and properties to all clients.

#### `Weather.SyncAct(type: WeatherAct, ...args)`

Syncs a [WeatherAct](/shared-api/weather/weatheract) to all clients with the given type and arguments.

Example of spawning a tornado:

```lua
Weather.SyncAct(WeatherAct.SpawnTornado, vec3(0, 0, 0), 5.0)
```

#### `Weather.SyncProperty(type: WeatherProperty, ...args)`

Syncs a [WeatherProperty](/shared-api/weather/weatherproperty) to all clients.

Example of setting the tornado state:

```lua
Weather.SyncProperty(WeatherProperty.TornadoState, TornadoState.Moving)
```
