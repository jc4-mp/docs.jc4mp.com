# vec4

This class represents a four dimensional vector (x, y, z, and w). It is often used to represent colors (red, green, blue, and alpha).

When using it to represent a color, each value should between 0 and 1. For example, this is how you would represent a fully opaque red color:
```lua
local red = vec4(1, 0, 0, 1)
```

And this is how you would represent a half-transparent purplish color:
```lua
local purplish = vec4(0.52, 0.07, 0.93, 0.5)
```

Color channels (between 0 and 1):
 - `x` -> `red`
 - `y` -> `green`
 - `z` -> `blue`
 - `w` -> `alpha`

#### Constructor: `vec4(x, y, z, w)`

Use this constructor to create new `vec4` instances.

```lua
local myVec = vec4(5, 2, 8, 4)
```

#### Properties

`vec4` has four properties: `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`.

Example:
```lua
local myVec = vec4(5, 2, 8, 4)
print(myVec.x) -- Prints 5
print(myVec.y) -- Prints 2
print(myVec.z) -- Prints 8
print(myVec.w) -- Prints 4
```
