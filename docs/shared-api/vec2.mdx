# vec2

This class represents a two dimensional vector (x and y). It is often used to represent 2D screen coordinates.

#### Constructor: `vec2(x, y)`

Use this constructor to create new `vec2` instances.

```lua
local myVec = vec2(5, 2)
```

#### Properties

`vec2` has two properties: `x` and `y`.

Example:
```lua
local myVec = vec2(5, 2)
print(myVec.x) -- Prints 5
print(myVec.y) -- Prints 2
```
