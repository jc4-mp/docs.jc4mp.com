| `Ability.RetractTether`            | Allows the player to pull tethered objects or players towards each other.                        |
| `Ability.Wingsuit`                 | Allows the player to use the wingsuit.                          |
| `Ability.PlantedExplosives`        | Allows placement of explosives that can be detonated remotely.               |
| `Ability.Parachute`                | Allows the player to use the parachute.            |
| `Ability.ParachuteSlingshot`       | Allows the player to use the grapplehook while parachuting.  |
| `Ability.GrapplingHook`            | Controls whether or not the grappling hook is enabled.             |
| `Ability.Hammer`                   | Allows the player to use the grapplehook melee ability.                                                  |
| `Ability.MultiplePlantedExplosives`| Enables placement of multiple explosives simultaneously.                    |
| `Ability.Grenades`                 | Allows the player to use grenades.                        |
| `Ability.ExitVehicle`              | Allows the player to quickly exit any vehicle.                     |

Example of enabling the local player's ability to use the wingsuit:
```lua
Event.Add("ResourceStart", function(name)
	local localPlayer = Players.Local():GetGamePlayer()
	localPlayer:EnableAbility(Ability.Wingsuit)
end)
```

Make sure to enable abilities once the resource has loaded. In this example, it's using the `ResourceStart` event to ensure that the resource has fully loaded before enabling the ability. If the ability were enabled outside of this event, it might not trigger properly right when a player joins the server.
