# PlayerClient

A player's client instance. Inherits from the [PlayerClient](/shared-api/playerclient) class. You can use this class to get information about the player, such as their Character and NetPlayer.


## Player Class Hierarchy

The diagram shows the inheritance hierarchy of player-related classes. To navigate between classes:
- Get a `PlayerClient` using `Players.Local()`
- Get the `NetPlayer` from a `PlayerClient` using `:GetNetPlayer()`
- Get the `Player` from a `NetPlayer` using `:GetGamePlayer()`
- Get the `Character` from a `Player` using `:GetCharacter()`

  click NetPlayer href "/client-api/netplayer" "NetPlayer"
  click Player href "/client-api/player" "Player"
