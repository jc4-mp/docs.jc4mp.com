# Character

Character-related APIs. Inherits from [Damageable](/client-api/damageable). To use these, you must first have a reference to a character, such as the local player's character. Example:

```lua
local character = Players.Local()
local localChar = playerClient:GetCharacter()
```

## Player Class Hierarchy

The diagram shows the inheritance hierarchy of player-related classes. To navigate between classes:
- Get a `PlayerClient` using `Players.Local()`
- Get the `NetPlayer` from a `PlayerClient` using `:GetNetPlayer()`
- Get the `Player` from a `NetPlayer` using `:GI()`
- Get the `Character` from a `Player` using `:GetCharacter()`

  click PlayerClient href "/client-api/playerclient" "PlayerClient"
  click NetPlayer href "/client-api/netplayer" "NetPlayer"
  click Player href "/client-api/player" "Player"
  click Character href "/client-api/character" "Character"
  click Damageable href "/client-api/damageable" "Damageable"
  click GameObject href "/client-api/gameobject" "GameObject"
```

## Class Instance Methods

### Game Object Methods

#### `Character:GO(): GameObject`

Returns the GameObject instance of the character.

**Returns:** GameObject - The GameObject instance of the character

**Example:**
```lua
-- Get the character's GameObject for transform manipulation
local gameObject = character:GO()
local position = gameObject:GetPosition()
print("Character position: " .. tostring(position))
```
