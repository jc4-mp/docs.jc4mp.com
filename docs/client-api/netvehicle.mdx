## Class Instance Methods

<NetVehicleShared />

#### `NetVehicle:SetPartState(part: VehiclePart, state: VehiclePartState): void`

Transitions a [vehicle part](/shared-api/vehiclepart) to the specified state with animation. Only [VehiclePartState.Open](/shared-api/vehiclepartstate) and [VehiclePartState.Closed](/shared-api/vehiclepartstate) states are supported. Use [VehiclePartState.Open](/shared-api/vehiclepartstate) to animate the part opening, and [VehiclePartState.Closed](/shared-api/vehiclepartstate) to animate the part closing. The state change is not instant - the part will transition smoothly over time.

**Parameters:**
- `part: VehiclePart` - The vehicle part to control
- `state: VehiclePartState` - The state to transition to

**Example:**
```lua
-- Open a vehicle door
vehicle:SetPartState(VehiclePart.DoorFrontLeft, VehiclePartState.Open)

-- Close a vehicle door
vehicle:SetPartState(VehiclePart.DoorFrontLeft, VehiclePartState.Closed)
```

#### `Vehicle:GO(): GameObject`

Returns the GameObject (GO) of the vehicle, used to modify transform.

**Returns:** GameObject - The GameObject instance of the vehicle

**Example:**
```lua
-- Get the vehicle's GameObject for transform manipulation
local gameObject = vehicle:GO()
local position = gameObject:GetPosition()
print("Vehicle position: " .. tostring(position))
```
