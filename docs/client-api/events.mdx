# Events

List of all events that can be used to listen for events. For usage details and more events, see [Events](/shared-api/events).

#### `ResourceStart: (resource: string)`

Called when resource starts when a client joins the server. The first argument is the name of the resource that started. If you want to enable abilities for the local player, you should do it here.

```lua
Event.Add("ResourceStart", function(resource)
	if resource == Resource.Name then
		Local.UnlockAbility(Ability.GrapplingHook)
		Local.UnlockAbility(Ability.Parachute)
		Local.UnlockAbility(Ability.Wingsuit)
		Local.UnlockAbility(Ability.ExitVehicle)
	end
end)
```

#### `ResourceStop: (resource: string)`

Called when resource stops. The first argument is the name of the resource that stopped.

#### `ClientJoin`

Called when the local client joins the server.

#### `Render`

Called every frame. Use the `Render` event to draw elements to the screen underneath the JC4MP UI, such as the chat window. Learn more [here](/client-api/render).

#### `PostRender`

Called every frame. Use the `PostRender` event to draw elements to the screen on top of the JC4MP UI, such as the chat window. This is good for full-screen overlays, such as fading to black for transitions. Learn more [here](/client-api/render).
