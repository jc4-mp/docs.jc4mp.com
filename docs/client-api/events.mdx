# Events

List of all events that can be used to listen for events. For usage details, see [Events](/shared-api/events).

#### `ClientJoin`

Called when the local client joins the server. If you want to enable abilities for the local player, you should do it here.

```lua
Event.Add("ClientJoin", function()
	local localPlayer = Players.Local():GetGamePlayer()
	localPlayer:EnableAbility(Ability.GrapplingHook)
	localPlayer:EnableAbility(Ability.Parachute)
	localPlayer:EnableAbility(Ability.Wingsuit)
	localPlayer:EnableAbility(Ability.ExitVehicle)
end)
```

#### `Render`

Called every frame. Use the `Render` event to draw elements to the screen underneath the JC4MP UI, such as the chat window. Learn more [here](/client-api/render).

#### `PostRender`

Called every frame. Use the `PostRender` event to draw elements to the screen on top of the JC4MP UI, such as the chat window. This is good for full-screen overlays, such as fading to black for transitions. Learn more [here](/client-api/render).
