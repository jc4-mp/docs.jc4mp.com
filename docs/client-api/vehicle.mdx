# Vehicle

Vehicle game instance APIs. Inherits from [Damageable](/client-api/damageable). To use these, you must first have a reference to a Vehicle, which you can get from a [NetVehicle](/client-api/netvehicle) using the `:GI()` method.

```lua
-- Get a NetVehicle first, then get its game instance
local netVehicle = -- obtained from world or player
local vehicle = netVehicle:GI()
```
