# Overview

All singleplayer mods are compatible with Just Cause 4 Multiplayer. However, certain mods can cause the server to behave in unexpected ways, so keep in mind that some mods may not work as expected and might degrade the multiplayer experience.

Think of mods as a way to enhance the _static_ experience on Just Cause 4 Multiplayer - change the attributes of vehicles, change how things look, etc. But you can't create gamemodes with mods - you need to create scripts for that.


Mods are _static_, and scripts are _dynamic_.

# How to use mods on a server

To add mods to your server, set the `mods` field in your server config to true:


```json
{
    "name": "Just Cause 4 Multiplayer Server",
    "description": "A default server for Just Cause 4 Multiplayer",
    "port": 7777,
    "max_players": 100,
    "password": "",
    "announce": true,
    "key": "",
    "steam_web_api_key": "",
    "icon_url": "",
    "banner_url": "",
    "update_url": "https://servers.jc4mp.com/api/v1/servers",
    "mods": true,
    "startup_resources": [
        "resource1",
        "resource2",
        "resource3"
    ]
}
```

Then, create a new folder called `mods` in the root of your server. This folder will contain the mods you want to use on your server. Think if it like your server's dropzone - whatever you would normally put in your dropzone, you can put in your mods folder.

Mods will automatically sync to players when they join the server. If you add new mods, you will need to restart your server for them to take effect.

## Using a CDN

Hosting a lot of mods can put a lot of strain on your server. To avoid this, you can use a CDN to host your mods.

To do this, you can use a service like [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/r2/) or [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Cloudflare R2 has a free tier that allows you to store up to 10GB of data.

Once you have a CDN, you can set the `mods_endpoint` field in your server config to the URL of your CDN. If you use a CDN, your mods structure on the CDN must exactly match the structure of the `mods` folder on your server.

## Limitations

You are not allowed to change the intro video or the main menu. Specifically, these files will be overwritten by the server when the server starts:
 - `videos/sb_splash_loop_placeholder.bikc`
 - `videos/sb_splash_intro_placeholder.bikc`
 - `ui/front_end_pause_menu_i4.ddsc`
